                <h3>üçá Jam Juice MP3 Downloader</h3>
                <p>
                    Finally, no more dealing with these annoying scam websites!
                    I coded my own little YouTube to MP3 app with Python! Click below and you can have
                    unlimited free MP3s just by pasting in the YouTube URL. Burn CDs, whatever you want.
                    I don't even think there is a length limit.
                    Try it for music, affirmations, ambiance, or anything! The files will show up in your Music
                    folder.

                <h3>üçá Instructions</h3>
                <p>
                    1. Click the download button.<br>
                    2. If your computer says it's an untrusted file,
                    it's because I'm not a trusted publisher or something. Just click allow or whatever.<br>
                    3. Open your downloads folder.<br>
                    4. Right-click and extract zip file and click extract.<br>
                    5. If it gives you trouble again, just click trust file of whatever.<br>
                    6. Go back to your downloads. You should see a folder (not the zip) called jam_juice.<br>
                    7. Click into that, and there's the program! Click and drag onto your desktop.<br>
                    8. Double-click the program. Give it a few seconds to load.<br>
                    9. The program is a little pop-up. You just paste your youtube URL into it.<br>
                    10. The music file will appear in your Music folder. If you don't see it, check the Music folder
                    in OneDrive and the local Music folder as well.
