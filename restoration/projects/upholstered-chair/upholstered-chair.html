        <h1>Upholstered Rococo Revival Chair</h1>

        <!-- Intro -->

        <div class="intro">
            <h3>Purchase Info</h3>
            This chair was bought by me, Kalyn Morris, on September 19th, 2025 for $4.00 (!!!)
            from The Dove's Nest at 105 Cotton St, Chester, SC 29706.

            <h3>Initial Assessments & Dating</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    It's hand carved and imbellished and has imperfections all around.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Parts of it were done in sections and then attached together
                    to form the full back and arms of the chair. The back is in
                    3 sections. Unusual. But in some American shops of the 1850s–70s,
                    makers did occasionally piece together carved chair backs to
                    save on large hardwood blanks. It was cheaper than carving one
                    large piece, and once stained/finished, the seams weren’t too visible.
                    The rough, almost experimental way the splat is divided suggests a
                    regional maker or smaller workshop, not a high-style urban cabinet shop.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wooden inserts/dowels or pegs where the legs meet the seat,
                    instead of nails or screws. Hand-carved- some round, some square.
                    This is a good indicator of pre-1900 construction, because by the
                    early 20th century factories typically used uniform round machine
                    dowels and glue, not irregular pegs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    No modern fasteners/nails/screws.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The cushion has tapestry style fabric with upholstery tacks (row-type,
                    not individual unfortunately). All modern inside and out. Foam, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    White paint skids and platters in various places, extensive on the back.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Typical dirt on the upholstery, but still in impressive shape. The staples at
                    the bottom were a little sloppy.
                </li>
            </ul>
