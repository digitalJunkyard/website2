        <h1>1830-1855 Dresser</h1>

        <!-- Intro -->

        <div class="intro">
            <h3>Purchase Info</h3>
            This dresser was bought by me, Kalyn Morris, in September 2025 for $75.00. It was bought at Antiques at Hall
            Lumber Co in Chester, SC (106 Hudson St, Chester, SC 29706). The owner Rhett told me that his wife's
            relative
            owned this desk until her death. Her name was Mary Poteat and she lived in Marion, NC.
            She got a doctorate degree from Duke. She lived to be 96. He told me she would be 110-115 years old now,
            as of 2025. That would mean she must have been born 1910-1915. It would also imply she died around
            2006-2011.
            Rhett does not know where she got the dresser.

            <h3>Initial Assessments & Dating</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The dresser had to be cleaned extensively all over, and a lot of dirt came off, built up over time.
                    Some kind of small stuck-on white paint splatters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    General markings
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stripped finish in places.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dull finish.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Piercing squeak when drawers are opened from raw wood-on-wood tracks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tracks have beautiful visible file marks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Missing track under the bottom drawer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The backing of the dresser was replaced in the 1930’s-1960’s (likely the 1950’s), a common practice
                    for these old dressers. The sticker on the board says “Weldwood.” Weldwood plywood was introduced by
                    United States Plywood Corporation in the late 1930s and widely marketed through the 1950s–60s as
                    waterproof paneling/backing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hand-cut dovetail joinery- typically pre-1860. Later 19th century dovetails become more
                    machine-regular.
                    The locks are Corbin locks. Corbin Cabinet Lock Co. Company active from 1849 onward. The shinier
                    plating might indicate a later replacement.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Diamond-inset keyhole escutcheon- this was a style element seen in Federal/Empire through early
                    Victorian periods (c. 1820–1860). Nice!!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wood looks like Poplar, I’m unsure. Poplar is consistent with domestic, utilitarian furniture of the
                    time, whether finished plainly or intended for paint or veneer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Slightly asymmetrical filigree drawer pulls. Repeating asymmetry with visible file marks- early
                    sand-cast. The fact that they are slightly irregular and hand-finished suggests pre-1860
                    manufacture.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Flathead screws with round scratches on them. Looks like they’re cut nails, machine-cut but finished
                    by hand filing, common ca. 1790s–1880s. Since they are flathead, irregular, and show hand filing
                    marks, they’re probably in the 1830–1860 window.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each drawer is a different height.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wood work is hand-crafted- beautiful imperfections in every detail, such as the carved keyholes and
                    joinery.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Different drawer heights, imperfections, file marks on tracks - these are hallmarks of true hand
                    craftsmanship, not machine shop furniture.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Restoration Process</h3>
            <p>The restoration was carried out in accordance with professional conservation
                practices, with careful attention to preserving the dresser’s historical
                integrity. No artificial finishes, heavy sanding, or modern substitutions
                were employed.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The entire case and drawers were first cleaned with a mild vinegar-and-water solution to remove
                    accumulated
                    surface dirt without compromising the original finish.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I picked off the paint splatters entirely by hand.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Howard’s Restor-A-Finish (Walnut) was applied. This blended out minor surface abrasions,
                    white marks, and areas of worn finish, restoring continuity of color.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To condition and nourish the wood, Howard’s Feed & Wax was applied,
                    enriching the luster and adding a protective layer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All brass hardware, which retains its original sand-cast character,
                    was treated with Von Schneider’s micro-crystalline wax polish (Renaissance Wax),
                    ensuring protection against tarnish without the loss of historic surface detail.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The characteristic squeak of the raw wood-on-wood drawer runners was resolved by applying
                    Renaissance Wax to the points of contact.
                    This provided lubrication while respecting the original unfinished interiors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wood now has restored depth of color, minimized or erased abrasions or white marks, and is nourished
                    and protected.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I made custom covers out of a thrifted tablecloth. I washed it and cut it to size. It is NOT glued
                    and is completely removable. It’s all tied into place at the back of the drawers to prevent sliding.
                </li>
