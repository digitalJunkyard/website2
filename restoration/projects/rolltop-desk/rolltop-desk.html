        <h1>Victorian Roll Top Desk</h1>

        <!-- Intro -->

        <div class="intro">
            <h3>Purchase Info</h3>
            This roll top desk was bought by me, Kalyn Morris, on September 27th, 2025 for $125.00.
            It was bought at Antiques at Hall Lumber Co in Chester, SC (106 Hudson St, Chester, SC 29706).
            Rhett said that when the family business (Hall Lumber) was opened, this desk was already inside
            the building. The business was moved to it's current address in the 60's (named after Rhett's
            father's co-founder). Rhett's brother took the desk and had it in his law office for a long time.

                <li>
                    "A rolltop desk is a 19th-century reworking of the pedestal desk" -
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolltop_desk">Wikipedia</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Roll top was a little hard to open.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The top is removable and is secured by wooden pegs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The desk top itsself was nailed in after construction- we found the extra
                    nails unnecessary and are unsure what the story is with that. Many were
                    at slanted angles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Removable drawers with carved handles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Drawers were dirty, had a couple of mysterious substances and at least 3
                    ink types spilled. I wonder if any/all were quill ink!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Faded and damaged finish.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pull-out extensions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I found a couple of very old stamps lodged in the wood!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Missing key for the rolltop lock.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bottom connector/metal match for the lock is missing.
                </li>
                <li>Central support beam on the right side is missing. Several support
                    braces that were attached to that beam also missing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some of the metal drawer support stays are missing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Organization top drawers missing handles. One is missing an entire face
                    and one of the side panels, and is mostly dis-assembled.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finish was in good shape on the back and sides.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Random splotches of white paint, and some blue-ish paint were present on
                    the wood.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Desk top had a piece of wood serving as a divider from the roll-top part.
                    2 screws were damaged and no longer attached, but present and bent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Desk top wood is veneer and has veneer damage going through in one spot.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Process -->

        <div class="process">
            <h3>Restoration Process</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Took off the roll top and then unscrewed the desk top, got rid of
                    the recently added unecessary nails.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cleaned "lower body" of the desk with vinegar and water solution, inside
                    and out. That alone took a very long time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Carefully chipped off paint splotches/splatters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Used Howard's Restor-A-Finish in Walnut on all surfaces except for the
                    ones that were originally raw (like the underside).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Used Howard's Feed & Wax (beeswax, orange oil) to finish off the wood.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Moved the desk top back onto the "lower body." Screwed in the original necessary nails,
                    which were flathead.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Nailed in the piece of wood that served as a divider. The nails had to
                    be removed, straightened, and nailed back in.
                </li>
                <li>Cleaned the roll top portion seperately with vinegar and water solution,
                    including all the slats, raw portions, inner cubbies, roll tracks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Chipped off a lot of paint from all over, especially the top most surface.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once again, used Howard's Restor-A-Finish in Walnut on all surfaces except for the
                    ones that were originally raw (like the underside). This includes the inner cubbies,
                    which was challenging but do-able with my small hands.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once again used Howard's Feed & Wax (beeswax, orange oil) to finish off the wood.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Applied Renaissance Wax to the rolling tracks (wood) to respectfully lubricate
                    and protect.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cleaned all drawers inside and out. I did the best I could with ink stains
                    but only so much could be done.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I gave the drawer faces the same Howard's treatment routine as the rest of the wood.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I put in some cool Pioneer Woman kitchen shelf liner in 'Sweet Rose' onto the newly clean inner
                    drawers.
                </li>
            </ul>
