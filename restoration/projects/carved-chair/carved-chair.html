            <h3>Purchase Info</h3>
            This antique hand-made chair was bought by me, Kalyn Morris, on
            September 19th, 2025 for $3.00 (!!!) from The Dove's Nest at 105 Cotton St, Chester, SC 29706.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Spray painted gold unevenly and sloppily.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The back rest design looks very hand carved.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The legs and struts look hand turned and imperfect.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Definitely not mass produced - very hand-made.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The bottom used to be cane-woven, but all the cane except for wedged-in
                    dregs were left.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inset drilled seat frame.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A piece of thin plywood was cut to cover the seat. This wood was traced
                    with pencil in a way that suggests the owner intended to cut it to exact size
                    to fit the hole. This wood was also spray painted gold.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The holes for (hand-caned, not pre-woven insert) cane weaving are inset- unusual.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The wood that would be under the cane weaving was painted black.
                    I believe this is orginial. It is worn but still there. It was to
                    bring out the contrast and not detract from the woven look. Luckily,
                    this area was spared from the gold paint.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Uneven tool marks and asymmetry in wood turning.
                </li>
                <li>
                    No nails or screws- only hand-cut wooden dowels.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2><i>A safe and supported all-around estimate: 1845-1860 (maybe shifting toward the earlier side of that)</i>
            </h2>
            <p>Chat GPT's reasoning: <br>
                <b>1. Hand-Carved and Hand-Turned Construction</b>
                <br>
                The imperfect symmetry and visible tool marks on both the backrest carving and turned legs indicate
                pre-industrial craftsmanship.
                <br>
                By the 1840s–1850s, machine turning was common in large workshops, but many rural and small-town
                cabinetmakers still hand-turned components, especially in the South and along the East Coast.
                <br>
                The lack of perfect uniformity suggests bench-made rather than factory-made production.
                <br>
                <b>2. Caned Seat (Hand-Woven, Not Drop-In)</b>
                <br>
                Hand-caned seats were very common before the 1870s, when slip-in or machine-pressed cane panels began to
                dominate.
                <br>
                The fact that it’s a hole-to-hole woven seat (as opposed to a pre-woven panel) strongly suggests
                mid-19th century or earlier.
                <br>
                Before ~1840: most seats were completely flat on top; the holes went straight through a level frame. The
                binding cane had to be tied or pinned down manually.
                <br>
                After ~1845–1850: makers started routing or chiseling a shallow inset to make the finished seat appear
                more “flush” and protect the caning.
                <br>
                By ~1860–1870: this became a hallmark of factory-made “fancy chairs” and improved handmade versions
                influenced by factory designs.
                <br>
                <b>3. Joinery and Fasteners</b>
                <br>
                You mentioned no nails or screws, and wooden pegs or dowels instead. That’s a major pre-1870 indicator.
                <br>
                By the 1880s, most furniture—even decorative chairs—relied on some metal fasteners.
                <br>
                <b>4. Paint and Finish Layers</b>
                <br>
                The old black paint under the seat could be lampblack pigment in linseed oil—a common 1840s–1860s
                protective treatment for hidden wood surfaces.
                <br>
                The black underlayer being hard, thin, and matte fits 19th-century finishes (often used to seal unseen
                areas).
                <br>
                <b>5. Style and Form</b>
                <br>
                Without seeing the exact silhouette, the combination of cane seat + carved back + turned legs fits
                within the transitional period between late Federal and early Victorian designs.
                <br>
                These were often called “cottage chairs,” “fancy chairs,” or “parlor chairs.”
                <br>
                The craftsmanship leans toward vernacular or regional work, not factory-made. Given you’re in South
                Carolina, it could easily be Southern-made, possibly by a local cabinetmaker.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    CitruStrip was applied to almost the whole thing in pieces.
                    I chose this because I heard CitruStrip was more respectful to antique wood
                    than harsher paint strippers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I was using Clean Strip to clean off the paint stripper (after scraping off most of it)
                    and discovered that the Clean Strip was actually effective at stripping off the
                    paint by itsself. After discovering that, much of the wood was stripped that way.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using Clean Strip, I realized there was a bit of old wood finish, in the color
                    walnut I would say (dark-medium brown).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Through stripping, I also learned that it was at some point
                    painted off-white or white (why?), then stripped, then painted gold. Almost like
                    someone used to care about it and then things went downhill. The dregs of white
                    paint were recalcitrant and deep in crevices- hard to remove. Clean Strip didn't have
                    an effect. It had to be picked and scraped off.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using a small cleaning brush during the CitruStrip phase was VERY effective on the
                    hand-carved back panel. No picking required!
                </li>
                <li>
                    After it was all stripped, I coated the original black paint with Renaissance Wax
                    for protection.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I used Howard's Restor-A-Finish in Walnut.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I used Howard's Feed & Wax.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I bought a chair cane weaving kit on Amazon. The cane is 2.5mm.
